profile_props.js:
1. The input parameter Avatar({ person, size }) is a destructuring assignment of the props object. It extracts the person and size properties from the props object directly in the function's parameter list. This is a shorthand in React for extracting values from the props object passed to a functional component.
2. In <Avatar />, the person attribute represents an object with information about a person, including their name and imageId. The size attribute represents the desired size (both width and height) of the avatar image in pixels.
